# Salesforce MCP Server - Enhanced Edition

An enhanced MCP (Model Context Protocol) server implementation that integrates Claude with Salesforce, featuring **automatic external API integrations**. This server allows Claude to query, modify, and manage your Salesforce objects and records, plus **automatically set up integrations** with external services like WhatsApp, Slack, email, and custom webhooks.

## ðŸ†• NEW FEATURES - Integration Management

### **ðŸ”— Automatic Integration Setup**
Create integrations that automatically trigger when Salesforce records are created, updated, or deleted:

- **WhatsApp notifications** when new leads are created
- **Slack alerts** for opportunity updates  
- **Email notifications** for new cases

### **âš¡ Quick Setup Templates**
Pre-built integration templates for common scenarios:
- `whatsapp_lead` - WhatsApp notifications for new leads
- `slack_opportunity` - Slack alerts for opportunities
- `email_case` - Email notifications for support cases
- `webhook_custom` - Generic webhook for any use case

## Original Features

* **Object and Field Management**: Create and modify custom objects and fields using natural language
* **Smart Object Search**: Find Salesforce objects using partial name matches
* **Detailed Schema Information**: Get comprehensive field and relationship details for any object
* **Flexible Data Queries**: Query records with relationship support and complex filters
* **Data Manipulation**: Insert, update, delete, and upsert records with ease
* **Cross-Object Search**: Search across multiple objects using SOSL
* **Apex Code Management**: Read, create, and update Apex classes and triggers
* **Intuitive Error Handling**: Clear feedback with Salesforce-specific error details

#### 2. OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Flow
1. Create a Connected App in Salesforce
2. Enable OAuth settings and select "Client Credentials Flow"
3. Set appropriate scopes (typically "api" is sufficient)
4. Save the Client ID and Client Secret
5. **Important**: Note your instance URL (e.g., `https://your-domain.my.salesforce.com`) as it's required for authentication
